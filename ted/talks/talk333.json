(Music) ? Slide into the shimmering surface ? ? between two worlds. ? ? Standing at the center of time ? ? as it uncurls. ? ? Cutting through the veil of illusion. ? ? Moving beyond past conclusions. ? ? Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear. ? ? If I could be anywhere, ? ? if I could be anywhere, ? ? if I could be anywhere right now, ? ? I would want to be here. ? ? Searching for the future ? ? among the things we're throwing away. ? ? Trying to see the world ? ? through the junk we produce everyday. ? ? They say nothing lasts forever, ? ? but all the plastic ever made is still here. ? ? And no amount of closing our eyes ? ? will make it disappear. ? ? If I could be anywhere, ? ? if I could be anywhere, ? ? if I could be anywhere in history, ? ? I would want to be here. ? ? The Romans, the Spanish ? ? the British, the Dutch, ? ? American exceptionalism, so out of touch. ? ? The folly of empire repeating its course, ? ? imposing its will ? ? and ruling by force ? ? on and on through time. ? ? But the world can't take it very much longer. ? ? We're not going to make it ? ? unless we're smarter and stronger. ? ? The world is going to shake itself free of our greed ? ? somehow. ? ?

And the world can't take it, that you can see. ? ? If the oceans don't make it, neither will we. ? ? The world's gonna shake itself all the way free ? ? somehow. ? ?
