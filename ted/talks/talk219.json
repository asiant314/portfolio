{"title":"Danielle de Niese: A flirtatious aria","description":"Can opera be ever-so-slightly sexy? The glorious soprano Danielle de Niese shows how, singing the flirty \"Meine Lippen, sie küssen so heiss.\" Which, translated, means, as you might guess: \"I kiss so hot.\" From Giuditta by Frans Lehár; accompanist: Ingrid Surgenor.","fValues":[7, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],"text":"(Music) ? I don't understand myself, ? ? why they keep talking of love, ? ? if they come near me, ? ? if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand. ? ? I don't understand myself, ? ? why they talk of magic, ? ? that no one withstands, ? ? if he sees me, if he passes by. ? ? But if the red light is on ? ? in the middle of the night ? ? and everybody listens to my song, ? ? then it is plain to see. ? ? My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ? ? my limbs, they are supple and white. ? ? It is written for me in the stars, ? ? thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ? ? My feet, they glide and float, ? ? my eyes, they lure and glow. ? ? And I dance as if entranced, 'cause I know, ? ? my lips give so fiery a kiss. ? ? In my veins, ? ? runs a dancer's blood, ? ? because my beautiful mother ? ? was the Queen of dance ? ? in the gilded Alcazar. ? ? She was so very beautiful, ? ? I often saw her in my dreams. ? ? If she beat the tambourine ? ? to her beguiling dance, all eyes were glowing admiringly. ? ? She reawakened in me, ? ? mine is the same lot. ? ? I dance like her at midnight ? ? and from deep within I feel: ? ? My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ? ? my limbs, they are supple and white. ? ? It is written for me in the stars, ? ? thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ? ? And I dance as if entranced, 'cause I know, ? ? my lips give so fiery a kiss. ?
