              I enjoy working with designers and developers end-to-end to improve the user experience of a consumer product. For me this includes projects in the health domain such as smart home sensors, electronic medical records, and health interfaces, all with the goal of making health technology more accessible to the everyday consumer. I also enjoy working on data visualization projects where I get to transform dense data sets into exploratory visual interfaces that surprise, delight, and engage the user.

I apply a user-centered approach to iterate on visualization designs of smart home data. This first involves taking data from home based monitoring technologies and aggregating them into measures of wellness. The information is then presented as visualizations for the older adult stakeholder. Using focus groups, user interviews, and usability studies, I refine the designs from early mockups to interactive prototypes. I play the role of designer, developer, and user researcher in this project.

This is the first time that there has been an older adult focus, representing a distinct information need from that of other stakeholder groups. The visualizations are an important resource to empower older adults in managing their health and wellness while coming full circle in demonstrating the utility of a smart home environment.

                    <span class="emphasis">Overview:</span> To inform the design of health visualizations, I led a study to examine how older adults' graphical perceptual needs differed from those of the general population. I modeled the study after a classic psychophysics experiment by Simkin and Hastie (1986). I developed the tasks as an online survey using HTML, JavaScript, and PHP and sampled over 200 participants to compare performance across age groups. Participants were asked to make proportional and comparison judgments on segments of graphs representing different basic graphical elements.

                    <span class="emphasis">Impact:</span> Though cognitive graphical perception studies abound, they were conducted primarily within a university setting. Therefore participants represented a skewed population. This was the first time where we examined graphical perception with older adults. In comparing with the general population, we found older adults took longer but were on par in accuracy of graphical perception. We also found moderate differences in performance across graphical elements.

The tool was an interface that consisted of various applications nested in a hierarchical structure. However it was unclear how intuitive it would be to navigate within the hierarchy. To test this, I developed an online tree test that tracked the navigation within an abstract menu representation of the wellness tool. This was compared with traditional in-person usability studies.

We designed and implemented a paper survey distributed to 1,500 older adults in retirement communities throughout the Seattle area.

Even within older adults we found age group differences with a sharp distrust of Internet, television, and radio resources.
